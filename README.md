# Rgression-Models


ABSTRACT

In this project I have analyzed a housing dataset and using different regression models and used them to make predictions and did a comparative study of the results of each model.

DATASET

For my analysis I have used a dataset obtained from the StatLib archive (http://lib.stat.cmu.edu/datasets/boston). This dataset contains census data collected by the U.S. Census Service regarding the dwellings in Boston area.


METHODS

Data Visualization:

To understand the significance of the dataset I have performed a few data visualisation activities:

1. Histogram plot of prices of houses
2. Correlation plots between dependent variables
3. Heatmap of the entire dataset
4. Boxplot showing outliers


Models:

Used below regression Models:

1. Linear Rgression
2. Polynomial Regression
3. RIDGE
4. LASSO
5. Gradient Boosting
